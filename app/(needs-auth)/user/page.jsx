    '1. not as pictured, it wasnâ€™t denim, it is a flimsy blue cotton to look like denim. 2. shipping was $10.99 for 1st class, not priority. and returns are accepted, but get ready to pay $5.45 to return same weight package (15oz, which is xl, so probably heavier than most). so basically it will cost you 10.99 to try it on. 3. absolutely zero communication from seller.4. offered partial payment of $10- this is not to cover shipping- do not agree!!! basically he robbed me of $20, had to file claim',
